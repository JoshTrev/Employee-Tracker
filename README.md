# Employee-Tracker

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a Command Line Interface (CLI) application allowing the user to set up and manage a database of employees. This application requires "Node.js." To get started, type "npm install" in the "Employee-Tracker" folder to install dependencies. Use the "schema.sql" file to create a MySQL database and populate it with the "seeds.sql" file. To use the application type "node index.js" into the terminal. You start with a main menu giving you the following options:

* View By Department

* View By Role

* View All Employees

* Add Department

* Add Role

* Add Employee

* Update Employee

* EXIT

```
"View By Department" allows the user to view all employees of a selected department.
```
```
"View By Role" allows the user to view all employees of a selected role.
```
```
"View All Employees" allows the user to view all employees.
```
```
"Add Department" allows the user to add a department.
```
```
"Add Role" allows the user to add a role.
```
```
"Add Employee" allows the user to add an employee.
```
```
"Update Employee" allows the user to change the role of a selected employee.
```
```
"EXIT" exits the application.
```
